# Senior Project: Pentago
Simulation of the board game Pentago, with hopes of eventually have a machine play and learn the game using reinforcement learning. 

Using Numpy and Pygame, for graphics. 

If you have pip:
    pip install numpy
    pip install pygame
    
To play:
    run pentagowgui.py
    The first screen will be a start menu with the options of One Player and Two Player Game. Right now, they both lead to the same game, which requires two players. To place a chip on the board, simply press any empty space on the board. If the space is already filled up, your move will have no effect and you will have to click on another available spot. Every move requires a quadrant to be selected and a left or right rotation. Five pieces in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line are required to win the game.

TODO:
  Labeled indicative moves, (Space filled up, Quad and Rotation)
  Animation for the rotation of each quadrant
